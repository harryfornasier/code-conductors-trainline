# Code Conductors: Trainline Hackathon Project

## About the Project
This project was developed in 24 hours as part of a hackathon challenge hosted by Trainline. The challenge was to answer the question:

**"How might we connect rail travellers with one another to improve their travel experience and/or find the best value?"**

Our solution focuses on sharing the journey with a friend after you bought the ticket. The friend would click on the shared link and get an option to easily buy a ticket on a seat next to them.

## Functionality

There is not much functionality and only 4 pages. But in my opinion it includes some pretty impressive CSS
